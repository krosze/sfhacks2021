You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  C:\Users\margo\Documents\GitHub\sfhacks2021\application

? Are you ready to proceed? Yes
? Which Firebase CLI features do you want to set up for this folder? Press Space to select features, then Enter to confirm your choices. (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)Database: Configure Firebase Realtime Database and deploy rules, Firestore: Deploy rules and create indexes for Firestore, Functions: Configure and deploy Cloud Functions, Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites, Storage: Deploy Cloud Storage security rules, Emulators: Set up local emulators for Firebase features, Remote Config: Get, deploy, and rollback configurations for Remote Config

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

? Please select an option: Use an existing project
? Select a default Firebase project for this directory: whatsupbody-bc8d6 (WhatsUpBody)
i  Using project whatsupbody-bc8d6 (WhatsUpBody)

=== Database Setup
i  database: ensuring required API firebasedatabase.googleapis.com is enabled...
+  database: required API firebasedatabase.googleapis.com is enabled


Firebase Realtime Database Security Rules allow you to define how your data should be
structured and when your data can be read from and written to.

? What file should be used for Realtime Database Security Rules? database.rules.json
+  Database Rules for whatsupbody-bc8d6-default-rtdb have been written to database.rules.json.
Future modifications to database.rules.json will update Realtime Database Security Rules when you run
firebase deploy.

=== Firestore Setup

Firestore Security Rules allow you to define how and when to allow
requests. You can keep these rules in your project directory
and publish them with firebase deploy.

? What file should be used for Firestore Rules? firestore.rules

Firestore indexes allow you to perform complex queries while
maintaining performance that scales with the size of the result
set. You can keep index definitions in your project directory
and publish them with firebase deploy.

? What file should be used for Firestore indexes? firestore.indexes.json

=== Functions Setup

A functions directory will be created in your project with a Node.js
package pre-configured. Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.

? What language would you like to use to write Cloud Functions? JavaScript
? Do you want to use ESLint to catch probable bugs and enforce style? Yes
+  Wrote functions/package.json
+  Wrote functions/.eslintrc.js
+  Wrote functions/index.js
+  Wrote functions/.gitignore
? Do you want to install dependencies with npm now? Yes

have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

? What do you want to use as your public directory? public
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? No
? Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? Yes
+  Wrote public/404.html
+  Wrote public/index.html
